# Language Museum Dataset

## What's this project?

The goal of this project is to create an editable version of [_Language museums
of the world_](https://www.nynorsk.no/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/814-20180314-Language-museums-OG.pdf), edited by Ottar Grepstad of the Centre for Norwegian Language and Literature. 

This project is undertaken with permission from Per Magnus F. Sandsmark, General Director, Centre for Norwegian Language and Literature.

## Structure

Each museum's entry is a json file. Keys should include: name, last_updated, location, url, email, address, phone, and a description field, with the format "description_LANG" where LANG is the [ISO 639-1 two-character language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for the language of the description field.

## How to contribute

Please note that updates must be approved by the Center for Norwegian Language and Literature, so it may take some time for pull requests to be approved.
