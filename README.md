# Language Museum Dataset

## What's this project?

The goal of this project is to create an editable version of [_Language museums
of the world_](https://www.nynorsk.no/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/814-20180314-Language-museums-OG.pdf), edited by Ottar Grepstad of the Centre for Norwegian Language and Literature. 

This project is edited by Ottar Grepstad and published by the Centre for Norwegian Language and Literature, and undertaken with permission from the author. 

## Structure

Each museum's entry is a json file. Keys should include: name, last_updated, location, url, email, address, and phone. We are not including the description field from the PDF in our json files.

## How to contribute

Feel free to start transcribing the museums from the linked PDF above! Please send a pull request for the original PDF version before making updates to any of the data found within. 

Please note that updates must be approved by the author, so it may take some time for pull requests to be approved. If your pull request hasn't been approved within 30 days, please raise an issue.

Please note that all contributors are bound by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Wishlist

Eventually, we'd like to have a static site for this data. Help in setting this up greatly appreciated, but please raise an issue to discuss before starting to do a lot of work!
